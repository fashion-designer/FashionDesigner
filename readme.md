## About Project

The GARMENTOR is a skeleton application meant to take tailoring online. Any user can place an order and a designer/tailor will reach out to the user. All the communications take place in the application.

The GARMENTOR is a PHP Laravel application that supports three different login authentications(Admin, Designer, User). Three different middlewares are created to support this. Various models and migrations are created. The front-end was primarily implemented with JavaScript.

Although, I have changed the Table List and Profile Views to Vue JS. Used Vue Router to implement this.
